# Weather Analysis Data

## Overview

This project provides an analysis of weather data, with a focus on differences between temperature and humidity in two different cities. The dataset contains various weather-related metrics, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, collected over time. The project aims to perform statistical analysis and visualizations to uncover meaningful insights about weather patterns.
